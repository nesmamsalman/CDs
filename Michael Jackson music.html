                                            She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                            I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
                                            Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
                                            She said I am the one
                                            Who will dance on the floor, in the round
                                            She told me her name was Billie Jean
                                            As she caused a scene
                                            Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                            Who will dance on the floor in the round</p>

                                            Girl, close your eyes
                                            Let that rhythm get into you
                                            Don't try to fight it
                                            There ain't nothin' that you can do
                                            Relax your mind
                                            Lay back and groove with mine
                                            You got to feel that heat
                                            And we can ride the boogie
